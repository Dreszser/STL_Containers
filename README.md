# STL_Containers

Implementation of STL containers in C++

Educational group project, where we had to learn and develop our versions of STL containers(e.g. vector, queue, list, set)
I made Tree class and developed all containers that are based on the RB-tree.
So here is my part of the group project.

## Run Tests

- To run tests you need to have ```GoogleTest``` and ```lcov``` libraries installed
- *Keep in mind that test results may be different on different OS or CPUs*(I ran tests on Ubuntu)
- Then simply run ```make``` to build and run unit-tests or ```make gcov_report``` to generate html coverage report

## Topics I had to study

- Red-Black Tree data structure;
- Basic data structures: list, map, queue, set, stack, vector;
- Classes in C++;
- Overloading constructors/methods/operators;
- Iterators;
- Class templates.
